    ## Learning to code is hard, teaching yourself is harder. This guide will give it's best attempt to help you survive the journey.

    The survival guide is largely inspired by an album by Aesop Rock. [The Spirit World Field Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP8RgWJ76xE\&list=PL_AA8JeDxiPZP1ri2vu7Wwvvf3iC0qHsO)
    has a few quotes all from the first song that I would like you to keep in mind as you read this (and anything else I write).

    > My days here have been as rewarding as they are troublesome, and often dangerous.

    > I have been assembling my notes for some time now.
    > My intent is to create a guide for anyone whose path.
    > May lead them to this unwavering otherness (This unwavering otherness).

    > There are days I fear my work will only serve to create more confusion about what I've found.
    > But I felt it nеcessary to stay the course in hopеs that these insights may be illuminating for some.

    > There will be times when you will be tested in ways this guide can neither prepare you for, nor help you from.

    > Contained within are anecdotes, recipes, survival tips, warnings, maps, drawings, and more
