# {frontmatter.title}

Articles are the topics that warrant their own page, but likely will also end up (at least partially) shown in an `issue`.

Articles have access to some special tricks that make them easier to render inside an issue. One example of this is the `<More/>` component.

You can use `<More/>` to add things that should show in the article but be hidden when rendered elsewhere.

```astro
<More>
 Stuff that should be shown in the full article, but not in an issue. 
</More>
```
