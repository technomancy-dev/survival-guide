Yes, you... whoever you are.

I promise if you got yourself to this webpage and are reading this sentence then I think you have what it takes to teach yourself the fundamentals of programming, get yourself a remote job and change your life.

How do I know? Because I did it, and I have helped *several other people like yourself* do it.

  Programming for the web is not as intimidating as you may think, it's just very different from the things you normally do. This feeling of strangeness, of unfamiliarity, is often mistaken for difficulty. People often get overwhelmed long before they start.

  > Programming is not ~~rocket science~~, it's a *martial art*.

  Anyone with enough dedication can be a blackbelt in most martial arts schools. You could probably even form your own dojo pretty quickly into learning (relative to other careers) and start teaching other people your art. this is true for martial arts, it's true for web development, and it's not even close to true about rocket science.

  All it takes to become a programmer is the focus, dedication, and the will to become a programmer.

  ## Why would I want to learn to program?

  Good question, I have found this is different for everyone. At least a little bit. For me it was two things, the money and freedom to work remotely. but more than that, for me I was feeling trapped. That the mistakes I made when I was young doomed me to a life of shitty jobs, with the only hope of escape being making my own business, but its a little hard to start a business while fighting homelessness. For me, programming was a way out, a last-ditch effort to reach for a ledge as I fell off a cliff.

  If any of that speaks to you then I have good news, there is a cliff and it is not a get rich quick scheme or some crazy scheme. It is just an in-demand trade that if you put in the work to learn, you can secure a job for, but unlike other trades, you can learn this completely online from home.

  This might be the first time you are ever hearing this about programming. You may think of programming as something only super smart, super nerdy people do. Or it is only for those privileged enough to have a path to getting an engineering degree. This is simply not true.

  > I am a High School dropout, turned College dropout, turned moderately successful web developer.

  One day maybe I will even be a very successful web developer, **and maybe you will be too.**

  ## Ok but how do I start?

  I am working on a series of courses to make this as easy as possible, so that you can start **getting paid** to make sites. [Get started with the Intro to The Web](/pages/html-intro) which will work as a primer to set you up for success.
  The rest of the course is designed to get you up to speed with a fully modern tech stack with as direct of a learning path as possible.

  When I was learning how to code it was very difficult to pick a path, as I wanted to learn all the right things as fast as possible which is a pretty tricky thing to pull off.
  Often you should take a step back and dive deep in fundamentals, other times it makes sense to bulldoze towards the goal. My motivation for creating this course is to lay all that out as plainly as possible so that
  you can get productive making websites as fast as possible without putting yourself into a bad spot.
  {/* # Course Outline

              The general learning path will be

              ## **Learn the fundamentals**

              This will cover the very basic building blocks you will be using for the rest of the course. Simple and foundational stuff like how to use a text editor, what HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are and what they do. How to open and use the web debugger and other topics you absolutely must know before moving on.

              ### What is a text editor and how to use one.

              The tool you will be working in every day. It is important to pick a good one and learn it well, you will be spending a lot of time with it.

              ### What is HTML

              The foundation of the web, the *markup language* we will learn to add content to our sites. The first of three pillars of the web.

              ### What is CSS

              Why the web looks good. Before CSS websites were just simple text on a page. CSS gives us the power of pretty.

              ### **What is JavaScript**

              The devil in the details, JavaScript is a full blown programming language you can use to make the web do just about anything if you try hard enough.

              ## Build your first website

              You now have all the skills you need to build for the web. Although you may struggle a lot at this stage, you can make things and show them to the world. That is a really cool thing worth celebrating.

              ### Make a site the *old school* way.

              Lets make something you can be proud of, even if it is simple. We are going to put all the skills you have gained so far to make a very basic website. Then we are going to host it so you can show it off. The site will be a simple list displaying milestones in your web development journey and you can come back and mark them as complete as you achieve them.

              ### Breakdown the problems & theoretical ways it could be made better.

              We will look at this site objectively and talk about the issues it has, and I will talk about ways that this could potentially be solved so we know what solutions to look for.

              ## Level up with industry staples

              You have been learning with a pretty big handicap up until this point. You don't really have a way to use code anyone else has written, and web developers do that a lot. We call it "Standing on the shoulders of giants".
              So we are going to learn some tools to let you do that.

              ### Learn about Git

              This is where you will keep track of your code, and you will use GitHub to host and share that code (you have already used Github a lot at this point, just not in the way you are about to.)

              ### Learn about npm

              NPM stands for "No Problem Man" because anytime you run into an issue you can install some unknown package to solve it.

              ## Build a **better site**

              With these new tools you are equipped to address some of the problems we identified after making your first site. We will use modern tools to build a site the way pro's do.

              ### Learn about Astro

              Astro is the newest progression in a long history of static site generation. Like some before it, it actually can do a lot more. It is the perfect first tool for beginners as you can continue to grow and use it potentially forever.

              ### Learn about Tailwind

              Writing CSS from scratch and maintaining it can be a real struggle, because of this people often opt to use CSS libraries. The absolute best in my opinion is Tailwind CSS.

              ### Learn more JavaScript

              JavaScript does a lot of things, and you will continue learning JavaScript for the rest of your career. Let's kick that off by doing some more advanced stuff with it here. */}
